Tricky things
	* There are three oscillator controls
		* One relates to the base time-keeping oscillator
		* The 32khz pin allows access to this base oscillator
		* A third pin outputs a variable square wave

Can control all oscillators' behavior when on battery power

Thermometer reading is only updated when the calibration takes place

The frequency that calibration occurs can be adjusted (thus making temperature readings available at same rate)
