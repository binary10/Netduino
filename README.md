Netduino
========

In the course of learning the .NET Micro Framework -- and embedded programming in general -- I have amassed a humble numble... ahem... number of examples that might be useful for others. So, I'm doing the right thing and sharing them on GitHub.

#### Libraries
These are modules that can be used in your projects.

* [RealTimeClock]: A library for controlling the DS3232 clock chip over I2C.


#### Applications/Sketches
Pretty much all of these are beginner applications that I wrote while starting to learn embedded programming. They are classic examples of what types of things you can do with microcontrollers. I consider all of these sketches -- not full-scale applications -- so I haven't put a lot of work into making them very robust.

* [AlternateLightButton]: Toggle two LEDs with a button.
* [LightInterruptPort]: Demonstrates the use of the InterruptPort class for event signaling.
* [Servo]: Slow, automatic oscillation of a servo.
* [ServoPotControl]: Control a servo's angle by using a potentiometer.
